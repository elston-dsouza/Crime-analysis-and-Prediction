# Crime Data Analysis & Prediction (Ongoing)

## Overview

This project explores crime datasets to understand patterns, predict case closure rates, and estimate crime trends. The goal is to leverage data-driven approaches to support better insights into crime dynamics.

## Current Work

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Initial model experiments for predicting case closure rates

## Planned Features

- Advanced predictive models for crime rate forecasting
- Interactive dashboard for crime trend visualization
